Problem 1: Timing Function Execution
Problem: Write a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute.
Problem 2: Debugging Function Calls
Problem: Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of its arguments every time the function is called.
Problem 3: Cache Return Values
Problem: Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cached value is returned instead of re-executing the function.
